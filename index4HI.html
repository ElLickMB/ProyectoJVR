            <p align=center>Hello, my name is Joaquin Velasco Romero, 17 years old, creator of this page and a student at Technical High School No. 1.
                <br>
                Now I'm going to tell you a little about myself and how I feel about studying at this school.
                <br>
                I was born on December 16, 2002 in San Pedro Buenos Aires, I went to the garden No. 901, then I went to the school No. 42, to later finish where I am currently studying. I'm going to 6th Computer Science, despite being pessimistic about that, I'm also lousy in math hehe. 
                <br>
                Without a doubt and personally speaking, I would say that this school is not for everyone, since it offers double shifts which is very exhausting, for me I am a person who is always sleepy and very forgetful ... well let's say that I am not doing well at all .
                <br>
                Despite the fact that people told me to change schools, I don't like the idea of ​​losing the friends that I've already been making over the years, and not wasting that double shift either haha.
                <br>
                My plans for the future is to study Graphic Design in another city, or something else that has to do with drawing since it is one of the things I like the most and what I do best.
                <br>
                Well, that was it, a bit short but informative, right? haha.
            </p>
